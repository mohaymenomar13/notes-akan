**Business Environment** - The combination of social, legal, economic, physical, and political factors in which businesses conduct their operations. 

**Business Pressures:**

* **Market Pressures:**
    * **Globalization:** The integration and interdependence of economic, social, cultural, and ecological facets of life, made possible by rapid advances in information technology.
        * **Eras of Globalization:**
            1. **Globalization 1.0 (1492 - 1800)** - Driven by how much muscle, horsepower, wind power, or steam power a country could deploy.
            2. **Globalization 2.0 (1800 - 2000)** - Driven by the emergence of multinational companies.
            3. **Globalization 3.0 (2000 - Present)** - Driven by the convergence of ten forces Friedman calls “flatteners”.
    * **Changing Nature of the Workforce:**
        1. Diversified workforce
        2. Telecommuting
    * **Powerful Customers:**

    * **Information Overload:** The amount of information available on the Internet doubles approximately every year and is free of cost.
* **Technology Pressures:**
    * **Technological Innovation and Obsolescence:** Few and improved technologies rapidly create or support substitutes for products, alternative service options, and superb quality.
    * **Digital Divide:** Refers to the wide gap between those individuals who have access to information and communications technology and those who do not. 
* **Societal/Political/Legal Pressures:**
    * **Social Responsibility:** Social issues that affect businesses and individuals range from the state of the physical environment to company and individual philanthropy to education.
    * **Compliance with Government Regulations:** Regarding health, safety, environmental protection, and equal opportunity.
    * **Protection Against Terrorist Attacks:** Organizations have been under increased pressure to protect themselves against terrorist attacks.

**Organizational Responses:**

1. **Strategic Systems:**
2. **Customer Focus:**
3. **Make-to-Order and Mass Customization:**
4. **E-Business and E-Commerce:**
    * **E-commerce:** Describes the process of buying, selling, transferring, or exchanging products, services, or information via computer networks, including the Internet.
    * **E-business:**  Is more broad in concept as it includes servicing customers, collaborating with business partners, and performing electronic transactions within an organization.

**Competitive Advantage:**

* Any assets that provide an organization with an edge against its competitors in some measure such as cost, quality, or speed.
* It helps an organization to control a market and to accrue larger than average profits.
* Can be achieved through the efforts of their employees. 

**Business Processes:** 

* An ongoing collection of related activities that create a product or a service of value to the organization, its business partners, and/or its customers. It is comprised of three fundamental elements:
    1. **Inputs:** Resources
    2. **Resources:**
    3. **Outputs:**
* **Customer:**
    1. Internal to the organization
    2. External to the organization
* **Fundamental Metrics:**
    1. **Efficiency:** Focuses on doing things well in the process.
    2. **Effectiveness:** Focuses on doing things that matter. 
* **Cross-Functional Processes:** No single functional area is responsible for their execution. Multiple functional areas collaborate to perform the process. 
* **Note:** Good business processes are vital to organizational success. The first step of determining if business processes are well designed is to document the process by describing the steps, its inputs, outputs, and resources. The organization can then analyze the process and, if necessary, modify it to improve its performance.

**Information Systems & Business Processes:**

* **Information System (IS):**  A critical enabler of an organization’s business processes. It facilitates communication and coordination among different functional areas, and allows easy exchange of, and access to, data across processes. 
* **Vital Roles:**
    1. Executing the process
    2. Capturing and storing process data
    3. Monitoring process performance

**Competitive Advantage and Strategic Information Systems (SIS):**

* **Competitive Strategy:** A statement that identifies a business’s approach to compete, its goals, and the plans and policies that will be required to carry out those goals.  Focuses on achieving a desired outcome when competitors want to prevent rival companies from reaching the goal. Seeks to outperform its competitors in a critical measure such as cost, quality, and time-to-market.
* **SIS:** Provide a competitive advantage by helping an organization implement its strategic goals and improve its performance and productivity. Any information system that helps an organization either achieve a competitive advantage or reduce a competitive disadvantage qualifies as a strategic information system.

**Porter’s Competitive Forces Model:**

* **Framework:** Best-known framework for analyzing competitiveness.
* **Information Technology:** Demonstrates how IT can make a company more competitive.
* **Market Expansion:**
* **Major Forces:**
    1. **Threat of Entry of New Competitors:** Threat that new competitors will enter one’s market is high when entry is easy. The threat is low when there are significant barriers to entry.
    * **Entry Barrier:** A product or service feature that customers have learned to expect from organizations in a certain industry.
        * Type of entry barrier: Legal requirements: IT-based barrier
    2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** Supplier power is high when buyers have few choices from whom to buy. Supplier power is low when buyers have many choices. 
        * The Law on supply and demand enables buyers to find alternative suppliers and to compare prices more easily. On the other hand, companies use the Internet to integrate their supply chains, participating suppliers prosper by locking in customers.
    3. **Bargaining Power of Customers (Buyers):** Buyer power is high when buyers have many choices from whom to buy. Buyer power is low when buyers have few choices. 
        * The Law on supply and demand. Loyalty programs reduce buyer power.
    4. **Threat of Substitute Products or Services:** The threat of substitute is high if there are many alternatives to an organization’s products or services. The threat of substitute is low if there are few alternatives. 
        * The Law on supply and demand. Any industry in which digitized information can replace material goods must view the internet as a threat because the internet can convey this information efficiently and at low cost and high quality.
    5. **Rivalry Among Existing Firms in the Industry:** Threat from rivalry is high when there is intense competition among many firms in an industry. The threat is low when the competition is among fewer firms and is not as intense. 
        * The Law on supply and demand. Any industry in which digitized information can replace material goods must view the internet as a threat because the internet can convey this information efficiently and at low cost and high quality.

**Porter’s Value Chain Model:**

* **Value Chain:** A sequence of activities through which an organization’s inputs are transformed into more valuable outputs. It identifies points where an organization can use IT to achieve a competitive advantage. 
* **Primary Activities:** Relate to the production and distribution of the firm’s products and services.
* **Support Activities:** Contribute to the firm’s products or services.

**Ethics and Information Technology:**

* **Ethics:** Principles of right and wrong that individuals use to make choices that guide their behavior. Deciding what is right or wrong is not always easy or clear-cut. 
* **Ethical Frameworks:**
    * **Utilitarian Approach:** Ethical action is the one that provides the most good or does the least harm. The ethical corporate action would be the one that produces the greatest good or does the least harm for all affected parties (customers, employees, shareholders, the community, and the environment).
    * **Rights Approach:** Maintains that an ethical action is the one that best protects and respects the moral rights of the affected parties. Moral rights can include the rights to make one’s own choices about what kind of life to lead, to be told the truth, not to be injured, and to a degree of privacy.
    * **Fairness Approach:** Posits that ethical actions treat all human beings equally, or if unequally, then fairly, based on some defensible standard.
    * **Common Good Approach:** Highlights the interlocking relationships that underlie all societies. It argues that respect and compassion for all others is the basis for ethical actions. Emphasizes the common conditions that are important to the welfare of everyone. These conditions can include a system of laws.
* **5-Steps of the Framework:**
    1. **Recognize an Ethical Issue:**
        * Could this decision or situation damage someone or some group? 
        * Does this decision involve a choice between a good and a bad alternative?
        * Does this issue involve more than legal considerations? If so, in what way? 
    2. **Get the Facts:**
        * What are the relevant facts of the situation?
        * Do I have sufficient information to make a decision?
        * Which individuals and/or groups have an important stake in the outcome?
        * Have I consulted all relevant persons and groups?
    3. **Evaluate Alternative Actions:**
        * Which options will produce the most good and do the least harm? 
        * Which options best respect the rights of all the stakeholders? 
        * Which option treats people equally or proportionately?
        * Which option best serves the community as a whole and not just some member? 
    4. **Make a Decision and Test It:**
        * Consider all the approaches, which options best addresses the situation?
    5. **Act and Reflect on the Outcome of the Decision:**
        * How can I implement my decision with the greatest care and attention to the concerns of all stakeholders?
        * How did my decision turn out, and what did I learn from this specific situation?

**Ethics in the Corporate Environment:**

* **Code of Ethics:** A collection of principles intended to guide decision making by members of the organization.
* **Fundamental Tenets of Ethics:**
    1. **Responsibility:** Accepting the consequences of the decision.
    2. **Accountability:** Determining who is responsible for actions that were taken. 
    3. **Liability:** Legal concept that gives individuals the right to recover the damage done to them by other individuals. 

**Ethics and Information Technology:**

* **Privacy Issues:** Involves collection, storing, and disseminating information about individuals.
* **Accuracy Issues:** Involves the authenticity, fidelity, and correctness of information that is collected and processed. 
* **Property Issues:** Involve the ownership and value of information. 
* **Accessibility Issues:** Revolve around who should have access to information and whether a fee should be paid for this access.

**Framework for Ethical Issues:** 

**Information Systems and Business Processes:**

* **Areas:**
    1. **Executing the process:** IS help execute processes by informing people when it is time to complete a task, by providing the necessary data to complete the task, and, in some cases, by providing the means to complete the task.
    2. **Capturing and storing process data:** IS capture and store data, i.e. process data or transaction data. Data entry can occur in various ways, ranging from manual entry to automated methods. 
    3. **Monitoring process performance:** IS help monitor the state of the various business processes by evaluating information (e.g. instance level or process level) about a process.

**Excellence Measures:**

1. **Customer Satisfaction:** Optimizing and aligning business processes to fulfill customers’ needs, wants, and desires.
2. **Cost Reduction:** Optimizing operations and supplier processes.
3. **Cycle and fulfillment time reduction:** Optimizing the manufacturing and logistics processes.
4. **Quality:** Optimizing the design, development, and production process.
5. **Differentiation:** Optimizing marketing and innovation processes.
6. **Productivity:** Optimizing each individual’s work processes.

**Business Process Reengineering (BPR):**

* **Radical Redesign Strategy:** For making an organization’s business processes more productive and profitable.
* **Proposed by Michael Hammer and James Champy (1993):** They argued that to become more competitive, businesses need to radically redesign their business processes to reduce cost and increase quality. Authors further stress that IT is the key enabler of such change. 
* **Examining Business Processes from a “Clean Sheet” Perspective:** Determine how it can best reconstruct processes to improve business function.

**Business Process Improvement (BPI):**

* **Focuses on Reducing Variation in the Process Outputs:** By searching for root causes of the variation in the process itself or among the process inputs. 
* **Usually Performed by Teams of Employees:** That include a process expert - usually the process owner - as well as other individuals who are involved in the process.
* **Six Sigma:** A popular methodology for BPI initiatives.

**DMAIC:**

1. **Define Phase:** Documents the existing “as is” process activities, process resources, and process inputs and outputs, usually as a graphical process map or diagram; customer and customer requirements for the process output. 
2. **Measure Phase:** Teams identifies relevant process metrics, such as time and cost to generate one output (product or service) and collects data to understand how the metrics evolve over time. 
3. **Analysis Phase:** Examines the “as is” process map and the collected data to identify problems with the process (such as decreasing efficiency and effectiveness) and their root causes.
4. **Improve Phase:** Team identifies possible solutions for addressing the root causes, maps the resulting “to be” process alternatives, and selects and implements the most appropriate solution.
5. **Control Phase:** Establishes process metrics and monitors the improved process and after the solution has been implemented to ensure the process performance remains stable.

**Business Process Management (BPM):**

* **Management System:** Includes methods and tools to support the design, analysis, implementation, management, and continuous optimization of core business processes throughout the organization.
* **Integrates Disparate BPI Initiatives:** To ensure consistent strategy execution.
* **Important Components are Process Modeling:**

**Introduction to Information Security:**

* **Security:** Degree of protection against criminal activity, danger, damage, and/or loss.
* **Information Security:** Refers to all of the processes and policies designed to protect an organization’s information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruptions, modification, or destruction.

**Concepts:**

* **Threat:** Any danger to which a system may be exposed.
* **Vulnerability:** The possibility that the system will be harmed by a threat.

* Lack of management support.
* Today’s interconnected, interdependent, wirelessly networked business environment.

**Threats:**

* **Unintentional Threats:** Acts performed without malicious intent that nevertheless represent a serious threat to information security. Mistakes by employees pose a large problem as a result of lack of awareness concerning information security.
    1. **Human Error:**
    2. **Social Engineering:** Attack which perpetrators use social skills to trick or manipulate legitimate employees into providing confidential company information such as passwords. 
    3. **Tailgating and Shoulder Surfing:**
* **Deliberate Threats:** Acts performed with malicious intent that represent a serious threat to information security.

    2. **Information Extortion:** Occurs when an attacker either threatens to steal or actually steals information from a company.
    3. **Sabotage or Vandalism:** Deliberate acts that involve defacing an organization’s website, possibly damaging the organization’s image and causing its customers to lose faith.
    4. **Dumpster Diving:** Involves the practice of rummaging through commercial or residential trash to find information that has been discarded.
    5. **Theft of Equipment or Information:**
    6. **Identity Theft:** Deliberate assumption of another person’s identity usually to gain access to his or her financial information or to frame him or her for a crime.

    8. **Software Attacks:** Uses malicious software to infect computers. 
    9. **Alien Software:** Clandestine software that is installed in the computer through duplicitous methods. 
    10. **SCADA Attacks:** Supervisory control and data acquisition attacks, which are a large-scale distributed and control system.
    11. **Cyberterrorism and Cyberwarfare:** Malicious acts in which attackers use a target’s computer systems, particularly via the internet, to cause physical real-world harm or severe disruptions.

**Privacy:**

* **Information Privacy:** The right to determine when, and to what extent, information about you can be gathered and/or communicated to others.
    * **Rules:** 
        1. The right to privacy is not absolute and must be balanced against the needs of the society.
        2. The public’s right to know supersedes the individual’s right of privacy. 

* **Digital Dossier:** An electronic profile of you and your habits, and the process of forming a digital dossier is called profiling. Data aggregators (ex. LexisNexis, ChoicePoint).

**Strategies for Competitive Advantage:**

* **Trade-offs:** Any choice of strategy may involve trade-offs.
* **Strategies:**
    1. **Cost Leadership:** Produce products and/or services at the lowest cost in the industry. Ex. Walmart’s automatic inventory replenishment system.
    2. **Differentiation Strategy:** Offer different products, services, or product features than your competitors. Ex. Dell’s mass customization strategy.
    3. **Innovation Strategy:** Introduce new products and services, add new features to existing products and services, or develop new ways to produce. Ex. ATM by Citibank.
    4. **Operational Effectiveness:** Improve the manner in which a firm executes its internal business processes so that it performs these activities more effectively than its rivals. Ex. Increase quality, productivity, and employee and customer satisfaction while decreasing time to market.
    5. **Customer Orientation:** Concentrate on making customers happy. Ex. Web-based systems that can create a personalized, one-to-one relationship with each customer.

**Business-Information Technology Alignment:**

* “Holy Grail” of organizations which defines as the tight integration of the IT function with the organization’s strategy, mission, and goals. 
* The IT function directly supports the business objectives of the organization.
* **Characteristics:**
    1. Organizations view IT as an engine of innovation that continually transforms the business, often creating new revenue streams.
    2. Organizations view their internal and external customers and their customer service function as supremely important.
    3. Organizations rotate business and IT professionals across departments and job functions.
    4. Organizations provide overarching goals that are completely clear to each IT and business employee.

* **Solutions:**
    1. Adopt a process view to map and improve IT processes to achieve greater alignment.
    2. Utilize enterprise architecture to foster alignment. Enterprise architecture is originally developed as a tool to organize a company’s IT initiatives. It encompasses both a technical specification (ICT) and a business specification (a collection of core business processes and management activities).
